When you block someone on Twitter, you may still see their messages. In search results. Or even your own timeline, if someone else retweets/quotes them.

Users discovered a simple CSS workaround, since tweets are internally flagged as to whether you're blocking the author.

However Tweetdeck does *not* have that flag. As a consequence, its AJAX interface includes a menu item to block, but it never knows when to provide an UN-block option. This also means third party scripts don't have an easy way to identify and remove unwanted tweets.

About
-----

This extension fixes Tweetdeck the hard way. It connects to Twitter - acting as an app - to fetch a list of blocked user ids. Whenever you're using Tweetdeck, this extension will monitor the page, scrape user ids, check the list, and redact any tweets that contain a match.


Setup
-----

In order to connect to Twitter on your behalf, you'll first need to bring up this extension's options. Then do a one-time PIN authorization. After that, click the "Fetch Current Block List" button whenever you need to.

Any time you're on Tweetdeck, a clickable-icon will appear in the address bar to toggle redaction.
